# Gigavel

**Gigavel** is a minimalist Laravel-style PHP MVC framework — built for developers who want the structure of Laravel without the bloat. It comes powered by **HTMX** and **Alpine.js**, enabling reactive and dynamic interfaces with almost zero JavaScript code.

> ✨ The smallest Laravel-like MVC with just enough magic and full control.

## ⚙️ Core Stack

- 🐘 **PHP MVC** – Models, Views, and Controllers inspired by Laravel's architecture.
- ⚡ **HTMX (~14kB)** – Handles dynamic content, AJAX, and HTML swaps declaratively.
- 🔮 **Alpine.js (~7kB)** – Gives reactivity like Vue but fits in your HTML.
- 🪶 **Super lightweight** – ~21kB of JS, near-zero boilerplate, blazing fast.

## 💡 HTMX + Alpine vs. Livewire

| Feature              | HTMX + Alpine.js        | Laravel Livewire          |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Initial JS Load      | ⚡ ~21kB                 | 🐘 ~80-100kB               |
| Page Updates         | ⚡ HTML swaps            | 🐢 JSON + DOM rehydration |
| PHP Integration      | ✅ Return views directly | ✅ Full reactivity         |
| Manual JS Needed     | ❌ Minimal               | ✅ Required                |
| Speed                | ⚡ Faster overall        | 🐢 Heavier & slower        |

**✅ Verdict**: HTMX + Alpine wins for raw speed, control, and simplicity — perfect for Gigavel’s lean mission.

## ✨ Example Usage

### Define a Route (`config/routes.php`)

```php
return [
    '/' => ['App\Controllers\HomeController', 'index']
];
```


Create a Controller (app/Controllers/HomeController.php)

```

namespace App\Controllers;

class HomeController {
    public function index() {
        require_once __DIR__ . '/../../resources/views/home.php';
    }
}

```

Build a View (resources/views/home.php)

```

<h1 hx-get="/some-action" hx-swap="outerHTML">Click me</h1>

<div x-data="{ open: false }" @click="open = !open">
    <p x-show="open">Hello from Alpine!</p>
</div>
```


🧪 Philosophy

    Gigavel is about fast iteration and keeping your tools out of your way.
    It gives you enough Laravel-style structure to scale while staying lean and snappy.
